# World_Weather_Analysis

Overview of Analysis
To compile a dataset from start, extracting from the OpenweatherApp site, through a gmap figure of specific travel locations. This module was more involved with other modules, in the sense of utilizing many more tools. 

Summary
Throughout this module there were some confusing aspects about which file to use as you are learning the material. Switching from WeatherPy to API_practice without warning was a little more difficult to infer. Overall the project did show me various useful tools. I had an issue using PythonData for citipy it would not work for me. I re-installed it several times and found no solution. I ended up using Python3 and it worked perfectly so all of my files for this module are through Python3 vs PythonData. The other issue I came across was in deliverable 1, the current descripton. Setting the inner dictionary was covered but I spun my wheels on that for a moment. Overall the project was very enjoyable and want to use this when I go on vacation!

Using gmaps to get the vacation search information was very exciting. Then learning how to search for temperatures, the weather descriptions, and even the biking (or driving) distance between cities was extremely interesting to learn. Thinking about doing a google search where you are basically just giving the parameters and then it parses through the data and then we parse through the data ourselves, was very fun. 

Result

I chose Spain as a travel destination for my Vacation_Itinerary. It's somewhere I've always wanted to go to and learned a good amount through this exercise. Starting in Bacelona and then hitting some more quiet towns and exploring is my ideal vacation. The cities I reviewed were much further apart than I initially thought, so driving was the best option for travel. Using the directions layer really gave clarity to that fact. Also being able to add pop-up markers was also very helpful to any traveler. This was a very enjoyable exercise and will definitely use this going forward.
